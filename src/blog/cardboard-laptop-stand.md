This is a laptop stand I made completeley out of carboard.
I wanted something to raise my laptop up and I had a bunch of boxes laying around so I decided to see what I could make with them.
It turned out pretty well given the materials.

### Tools/Supplies
- Cardboard
- White glue and Hot glue
- sharp knife
- cutting mat
- sandpaper and sanding block

### Construction
The process of building the stand consisted of cutting the cardboard to shape and then gluing several layers together to provide enough strength to support a laptop.
The two side supports ended up each being 5 layers thick and most other pieces were at least 2 layers thick.
I mostly used white glue to glue everthing together and used hot glue when there wasn't a good flat surface to glue to; e.g. gluing to the edge of the cardboard.
The hot glue also allows more rapid construction since it cools relatively quickly.

In conclusion, this was a fun project to work on and cost me almost nothing to make.
Cardboard worked suprisingly well as a building material and I ended up with a practical and sturdy stand for my laptop.
