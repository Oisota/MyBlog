A simple website I made that generates [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton).
I was inspired to make it after watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk) episode of [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q).
I started off making it using pure JavaScript and the HTML DOM for the cells and later converted it to use Vue.js, TypeScript, and the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing.
