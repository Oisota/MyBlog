I am a software developer from Ohio currently working at [Grathwol Automation](https://grathwolautomation.com/) developing telematics software and web applications.
My main specialty is building web applications using Python/Flask on the backend with JavaScript/Vue.js on the frontend.
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from Cleveland State University in 2016.
Some of my other interests include music, guitar, sailing, gaming, and electronics.

My technical skills are listed below.
If you would like to send me a message, feel free to do so using the [contact page](/contact) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
