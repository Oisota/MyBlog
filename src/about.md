I am a graduate of Cleveland State University with a bachelor's degree in computer science.
I love developing software and learning about new tools and technologies.
I'm interested in all things related to programming, especially free and open source software.
Some of my other interests include music, sailing, gaming, and electronics.
Currently, I'm working at Grathwol Automation developing telematics software and web applications.
