I am a software developer from Ohio currently working at [Avantia Inc.](https://www.avantia-inc.com/) developing web applications.
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from Cleveland State University in 2016.
My main skill set is building web applications using Python and JavaScript.
Some of my other interests include music, guitar, sailing, gaming, electronics, and woodworking.

I built this website to showcase my skills and projects as well as a place to write about things I find interesting.

My technical skills are listed below and my full resume can be viewed [here](/resume.pdf).
If you would like to send me a message, feel free to do so using the [contact page](/contact) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
