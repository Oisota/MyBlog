I am a software developer from Ohio currently working for [Astec Industries](https://www.astecindustries.com/) (formerly Grathwol Automation) developing telematics software and web applications.
My primary skill set is building web applications using Python/Flask on the backend with JavaScript/Vue.js on the frontend.
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from Cleveland State University in 2016.
Some of my other interests include music, guitar, sailing, gaming, electronics, and woodworking.

I built this website to showcase my skills and projects as well as a place to write about things I find interesting.

My technical skills are listed below and my full resume can be viewed [here](/resume.pdf).
If you would like to send me a message, feel free to do so using the [contact page](/contact) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
